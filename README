This project contains a Hyde [1] installation used to generate a 
possible website spreadwebm.com, which would promote use of the WebM 
video format and the VP8 (vpx) video codec.

The installation has any number of dependencies (beyond Hyde itself), 
which will be documented here should the project proceed.

  * hyde
  * Django
  * PyYAML
  * python-markdown
  * smartypants.py
  * python-pygments
  * fabric
